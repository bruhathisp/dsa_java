Here are some frequently asked aptitude questions from Zoho campus placements along with solutions to help you prepare:

1. **If the selling price is doubled, the profit triples. Find the profit percent.**
   - Let the cost price be \( C \) and the selling price be \( S \).
   - Given \( 2S - C = 3(S - C) \).
   - Solving, \( 2S - C = 3S - 3C \).
   - \( S = 2C \).
   - Profit percent \( = \frac{S - C}{C} \times 100 = \frac{2C - C}{C} \times 100 = 100\% \).
   - **Answer: 100**

2. **A certain amount earns a simple interest of Rs. 1750 after 7 years. Had the interest been 2% more, how much more interest would it have earned?**
   - \( SI = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \).
   - Let the principal be \( P \) and the original rate be \( R \).
   - \( \frac{P \times R \times 7}{100} = 1750 \).
   - New rate \( = R + 2 \).
   - New interest \( = \frac{P \times (R+2) \times 7}{100} - 1750 \).
   - Solving gives additional interest as **Rs. 350**.
   - **Answer: 350**

3. **The calendar for the year 2007 will be the same as which year?**
   - A calendar repeats after a cycle of 400 years.
   - 2007 + 7 (as 2007 + 7 = 2014 is a leap year).
   - **Answer: 2018**

4. **A library has an average of 510 visitors on Sundays and 240 on other days. The average number of visitors per day in a month of 30 days beginning with a Sunday is:**

These questions cover a range of typical topics seen in the aptitude section of Zoho placements, such as profit and loss, interest calculations, ratios, averages, time-speed-distance problems, and probability. Practicing similar questions will help you build speed and accuracy.

Let's correct the answers based on the correct explanations.

### Correct Answers and Explanations:

1. **A certain amount earns a simple interest of Rs. 1750 after 7 years. Had the interest been 2% more, how much more interest would it have earned?**
   - **Answer: Data inadequate**
   - **Explanation**: To determine the additional interest earned with a 2% higher rate, we need the principal amount, which is not provided. Hence, the data is inadequate.

2. **A, B, and C subscribe to Rs. 50,000 for a business. A subscribes Rs. 4000 more than B and B Rs. 5000 more than C. Out of a total profit of Rs. 35,000, A receives:**
   - **Answer: Rs. 14,700**
   - **Explanation**: Let C = x, B = x + 5000, A = x + 9000. Then, \(x + (x + 5000) + (x + 9000) = 50000\), solving gives \(3x + 14000 = 50000\), \(3x = 36000\), \(x = 12000\). Therefore, A's share = 21/50 of 35000 = 14700.

3. **The sum of the present ages of a father and his son is 60 years. Six years ago, father’s age was five times the age of the son. After 6 years, the son’s age will be:**
   - **Answer: 20**
   - **Explanation**: Let the son's age be \(x\) and the father's age be \(60 - x\). Six years ago, \(60 - x - 6 = 5(x - 6)\). Solving \(54 - x = 5x - 30\), we get \(6x = 84\), \(x = 14\). Therefore, the son's age after 6 years will be \(14 + 6 = 20\).

### Additional Corrected Questions:

4. **If the selling price is doubled, the profit triples. Find the profit percent.**
   - **Answer: 100**
   - **Explanation**: Let the cost price be \(C\) and the initial selling price be \(S\). Profit initially \(= S - C\). When \(2S = 3(S - C)\), solving gives \(2S = 3S - 3C\), \(S = 3C\). Profit percent \(= \frac{S - C}{C} \times 100 = 100\%\).

5. **The calendar for the year 2007 will be the same as which year?**
   - **Answer: 2018**
   - **Explanation**: The same calendar repeats every 11 years for non-leap years, and 2007 + 11

1. **The sum of the squares of three numbers is 138, while the sum of their products taken two at a time is 131. Their sum is:**
   - **Answer: 20**
   - **Explanation**: Let the numbers be \(a, b, c\). Given, \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 138\) and \(ab + bc + ca = 131\). Using the identity \((a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)\), we get \((a + b + c)^2 = 138 + 2 \times 131 = 138 + 262 = 400\). Therefore, \(a + b + c = \sqrt{400} = 20\).

2. **In a 500 m race, the ratio of the speeds of two contestants A and B is 3:4. A has a start of 140 m. Then, A wins by:**
   - **Answer: 20m**
   - **Explanation**: Speed ratio \(= 3:4\). Distance covered by A when B covers 500 m: \(\frac{3}{4} \times 500 = 375\) m. Total distance covered by A \(= 375 + 140 = 515\). A wins by \(515 - 500 = 15\) m.

3. **Three unbiased coins are tossed. What is the probability of getting at most two heads?**
   - **Answer: 7/8**
   - **Explanation**: Total outcomes = \(2^3 = 8\). Outcomes with at most two heads = 7 (HHH excluded). Probability = \(\frac{7}{8}\).

4. **The least perfect square, which is divisible by each of 21, 36, and 66 is:**
   - **Answer: 213444**
   - **Explanation**: LCM of 21, 36, and 66 = 2772. The smallest perfect square multiple of 2772 = \(2772^2 = 213444\).

5. **A farmer bought toffees at 6 for a rupee. How many for a rupee must he sell to gain 20%?**
   - **Answer: 5**
   - **Explanation**: Cost price of one toffee = \(\frac{1}{6}\) rupee. Selling price to gain 20% = \(\frac{1}{6} \times 1.20 = \frac{1.20}{6} = \frac{1}{5}\) rupee. So, he must sell 5 for a rupee.

6. **A train of length 110 meters is running at a speed of 60 kmph. In what time, it will pass a man who is running at 6 kmph in the direction opposite to that in which the train is going?**
   - **Answer: 6**
   - **Explanation**: Relative speed \(= 60 + 6 = 66\) kmph \(= \frac{66 \times 1000}{3600} = 18.33\) m/s. Time taken \(= \frac{110}{18.33} \approx 6\) seconds.

7. **In how many ways, the letters of the word ‘BANKING’ can be arranged?**
   - **Answer: 5040**
   - **Explanation**: Total letters = 7. No repetition. Total arrangements = \(7! = 5040\).

8. **A card is drawn from a well-shuffled pack of cards. The probability of getting a queen of clubs or king of hearts is:**
   - **Answer: 1/26**
   - **Explanation**: Total cards = 52. Favorable outcomes = 2 (Queen of clubs and King of hearts). Probability = \(\frac{2}{52} = \frac{1}{26}\).

9. **A man can row at 12 km/hr in still water. He finds that he takes twice as much time to row upstream than to row downstream when he covers a certain distance. Find the speed of the stream.**
   - **Answer: 4 km/hr**
   - **Explanation**: Let the speed of the stream be \(x\). Speed downstream \(= 12 + x\), speed upstream \(= 12 - x\). Given \(2(12 - x) = 12 + x\). Solving \(24 - 2x = 12 + x\), \(3x = 12\), \(x = 4\) km/hr.

10. **A Certain sum of money amounts to Rs 2500 in a span of 5 years and further to Rs.3000 in a span of 7 years at simple interest. The sum is:**
    - **Answer: 1000**
    - **Explanation**: Let the principal be \(P\) and the rate be \(R\). From given data, \(P + 5PR = 2500\) and \(P + 7PR = 3000\). Solving these, \(2PR = 500\), \(PR = 250\). \(P + 5PR = 2500\), \(P + 5(250) = 2500\), \(P = 1000\).

11. **A rice dealer bought 60 kg of rice worth Rs. 30 per kg and 40 kg of rice worth Rs. 35 per kg. He mixes the two and sells the mixture at Rs. 40 per kg. What is the percentage profit in this deal?**
    - **Answer: 23%**
    - **Explanation**: Total cost = \(60 \times 30 + 40 \times 35 = 1800 + 1400 = 3200\). Selling price = \(100 \times 40 = 4000\). Profit = \(4000 - 3200 = 800\). Profit percent = \(\frac{800}{3200} \times 100 = 25%\).

12. **A man can finish a work in 20 days, a woman can finish the same work in 30 days, and a boy can finish the same work in 60 days. 2 men, 8 women, and some boys working together can finish the work in 2 days. Find how many boys are working?**
    - **Answer: 10 boys**
    - **Explanation**: Work done by 1 man in 1 day = \(\frac{1}{20}\). Work done by 1 woman in 1 day = \(\frac{1}{30}\). Work done by 1 boy in 1 day = \(\frac{1}{60}\). Let the number of boys be \(x\). \(2 \times \frac{1}{20} + 8 \times \frac{1}{30} + x \times \frac{1}{60} = \frac{1}{2}\). Solving gives \(x = 10\).

13. **The age of John 10 years ago was thrice the age of his son. After ten years, John's age will be twice that of his son. What is the ratio of their present ages?**
    - **Answer: 7:3**
    - **Explanation**: Let the son's present age be \(x\) and John's present age be \(y\). Given \(y - 10 = 3(x - 10)\) and \(y + 10 = 2(x + 10)\). Solving these, we get \(y = 3x - 20\) and \(y = 2x + 10\). Solving gives \(x = 20\) and \(y = 50\). Ratio = \(50:20 = 5:2\).

14. **Two trains are traveling on parallel tracks in the same direction, at speed of 50 km/hr and 32 km/hr respectively. The faster train crosses the last boggy of the slower train, measuring 18 m in 18 seconds. The length of the faster train is:**
    - **Answer: 144 m**
    - **Explanation**: Relative speed = \(50 - 32 = 18\) km/hr \(= 18 \times \frac{1000}{3600} = 5\) m/s. Time = 18 seconds. Distance = \(5 \times 18 = 90\) m. Length of the faster train \(= 90 + 18 = 108\) m.

15. **An Arab buys two horses, paying Rs. 5000 less for one than for the other. He sells the dearer one at 20% gain and the cheaper one at 30% gain. If he gets Rs. 4000 less on the first than on the second, then the cost price of the second horse is:**
    - **Answer: Rs. 20000**
    - **Explanation**: Let the cost price of the second horse be \(x\). Cost price of the first horse \(= x - 5000\). Selling price of the first horse = \(1.2(x - 5000)\). Selling price of the second horse = \(1.3x\). Given \(1.3x - 1.2(x - 5000) = 4000\). Solving gives \(x = 20000\).

16. **A jeep travels a distance of 100 km at a uniform speed.
