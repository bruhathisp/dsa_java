Here are some frequently asked aptitude questions from Zoho campus placements along with solutions to help you prepare:

1. **If the selling price is doubled, the profit triples. Find the profit percent.**
   - Let the cost price be \( C \) and the selling price be \( S \).
   - Given \( 2S - C = 3(S - C) \).
   - Solving, \( 2S - C = 3S - 3C \).
   - \( S = 2C \).
   - Profit percent \( = {S - C}{C} \times 100 = {2C - C}{C} \times 100 = 100\% \).
   - **Answer: 100**

2. **A certain amount earns a simple interest of Rs. 1750 after 7 years. Had the interest been 2% more, how much more interest would it have earned?**
   - \( SI = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \).
   - Let the principal be \( P \) and the original rate be \( R \).
   - \( \frac{P \times R \times 7}{100} = 1750 \).
   - New rate \( = R + 2 \).
   - New interest \( = \frac{P \times (R+2) \times 7}{100} - 1750 \).
   - Solving gives additional interest as **Rs. 350**.
   - **Answer: 350**

3. **The calendar for the year 2007 will be the same as which year?**
   - A calendar repeats after a cycle of 400 years.
   - 2007 + 7 (as 2007 + 7 = 2014 is a leap year).
   - **Answer: 2018**

4. **A library has an average of 510 visitors on Sundays and 240 on other days. The average number of visitors per day in a month of 30 days beginning with a Sunday is:**
   - Number of Sundays = 5.
   - Total visitors = \( 5 \times 510 + 25 \times 240 = 2550 + 6000 = 8550 \).
   - Average per day = \( \frac{8550}{30} = 285 \).
   - **Answer: 285**

5. **What will be the least number that when doubled will be exactly divisible by 12, 18, 21, and 30?**
   - LCM of 12, 18, 21, 30 = 1260.
   - Least number = 1260 / 2 = 630.
   - **Answer: 1260**

6. **A motorboat, whose speed is 15 km/hr in still water goes 30 km downstream and comes back in a total of 4 hours 30 minutes. The speed of the stream (in km/hr) is:**
   - Let the speed of the stream be \( x \).
   - Downstream speed \( = 15 + x \).
   - Upstream speed \( = 15 - x \).
   - Total time = 4.5 hours.
   - \( \frac{30}{15+x} + \frac{30}{15-x} = 4.5 \).
   - **Explanation**: Cost price of one toffee = \(\frac{1}{6}\) rupee. Selling price to gain 20% = \(\frac{1}{6} \times 1.20 = \frac{1.20}{6} = \frac{1}{5}\) rupee. So, he must sell 5 for a rupee.

6. **A train of length 110 meters is running at a speed of 60 kmph. In what time, it will pass a man who is running at 6 kmph in the direction opposite to that in which the train is going?**
   - **Answer: 6**
   - **Explanation**: Relative speed \(= 60 + 6 = 66\) kmph \(= \frac{66 \times 1000}{3600} = 18.33\) m/s. Time taken \(= \frac{110}{18.33} \approx 6\) seconds.

7. **In how many ways, the letters of the word ‘BANKING’ can be arranged?**
