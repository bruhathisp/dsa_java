Here are some frequently asked aptitude questions from Zoho campus placements along with solutions to help you prepare:

## Frequently Asked Questions

1. **If the selling price is doubled, the profit triples. Find the profit percent.**
   - Let the cost price be C and the selling price be S.
   - Given 2S - C = 3(S - C).
   - Solving, 2S - C = 3S - 3C.
   - S = 2C.
   - Profit percent = (S - C) / C * 100 = (2C - C) / C * 100 = 100%.
   - **Answer: 100**

2. **A certain amount earns a simple interest of Rs. 1750 after 7 years. Had the interest been 2% more, how much more interest would it have earned?**
   - Let the principal be P and the original rate be R.
   - (P * R * 7) / 100 = 1750.
   - New rate = R + 2.
   - New interest = (P * (R+2) * 7) / 100 - 1750.
   - **Answer: Data inadequate**
   - **Explanation**: To determine the additional interest earned with a 2% higher rate, we need the principal amount, which is not provided. Hence, the data is inadequate.

3. **The calendar for the year 2007 will be the same as which year?**
   - A calendar repeats after a cycle of 400 years.
   - 2007 + 11 (as 2007 + 7 = 2014 is a leap year, so next similar year is 2018).
   - **Answer: 2018**

4. **A library has an average of 510 visitors on Sundays and 240 on other days. The average number of visitors per day in a month of 30 days beginning with a Sunday is:**
   - Number of Sundays = 5.
   - Total visitors = 5 * 510 + 25 * 240 = 2550 + 6000 = 8550.
   - Average per day = 8550 / 30 = 285.
   - **Answer: 285**

5. **What will be the least number that when doubled will be exactly divisible by 12, 18, 21, and 30?**
   - LCM of 12, 18, 21, 30 = 1260.
   - Least number = 1260 / 2 = 630.
   - **Answer: 1260**

6. **A motorboat, whose speed is 15 km/hr in still water goes 30 km downstream and comes back in a total of 4 hours 30 minutes. The speed of the stream (in km/hr) is:**
   - Let the speed of the stream be x.
   - Downstream speed = 15 + x.
   - Upstream speed = 15 - x.
   - Total time = 4.5 hours.
   - 30 / (15 + x) + 30 / (15 - x) = 4.5.
   - Solving gives x = 5.
   - **Answer: 5**

7. **Odd one out – 6, 9, 15, 21, 24, 28, 30:**
   - 28 is not divisible by 3.
   - **Answer: 28**

8. **A man completes a journey in 10 hours. He travels the first half of the journey at the rate of 21 km/hr and the second half at the rate of 24 km/hr. Find the total journey in km.**
   - Let the total distance be 2x.
   - x / 21 + x / 24 = 10.
   - Solving gives x = 105.
   - Total distance = 2x = 210.
   - **Answer: 224**

9. **A, B, and C subscribe to Rs. 50,000 for a business. A subscribes Rs. 4000 more than B and B Rs. 5000 more than C. Out of a total profit of Rs. 35,000, A receives:**
   - Let C = x, B = x + 5000, A = x + 9000.
   - x + (x + 5000) + (x + 9000) = 50000.
   - Solving gives x = 12000.
   - Total capital = 12000 + 17000 + 21000 = 50000.
   - A's share = (21000 / 50000) * 35000 = 14700.
   - **Answer: 14700**

10. **The sum of the present ages of a father and his son is 60 years. Six years ago, father’s age was five times the age of the son. After 6 years, the son’s age will be:**
    - Let the present age of the son be x and the father be 60 - x.
    - 60 - x - 6 = 5(x - 6).
    - Solving gives x = 14.
    - Son's age after 6 years = 20.
    - **Answer: 20**

11. **How many times are the hands of a clock at a right angle in a day?**
    - In 12 hours, hands are at right angles 22 times.
    - In 24 hours, hands are at right angles 44 times.
    - **Answer: 44**

12. **In how many different ways can the letters of the word ‘LEADING’ be arranged in such a way that the vowels always come together?**
    - Vowels: EAI.
    - Consonants: LNDG.
    - Treat vowels as a single entity.
    - Total arrangements = 5! * 3! = 120 * 6 = 720.
    - **Answer: 720**

13. **The sum of the squares of three numbers is 138, while the sum of their products taken two at a time is 131. Their sum is:**
   - Let the numbers be a, b, c.
   - Given, a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 138 and ab + bc + ca = 131.
   - Using the identity (a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca), we get (a + b + c)^2 = 138 + 2 * 131 = 400.
   - Therefore, a + b + c = √400 = 20.
   - **Answer: 20**

14. **In a 500 m race, the ratio of the speeds of two contestants A and B is 3:4. A has a start of 140 m. Then, A wins by:**
   - Speed ratio = 3:4.
   - Distance covered by A when B covers 500 m: (3/4) * 500 = 375 m.
   - Total distance covered by A = 375 + 140 = 515 m.
   - A wins by 515 - 500 = 15 m.
   - **Answer: 20m**
   - **Explanation**: Speed ratio = 3:4. When A covers 360 meters, B covers (4/3) * 360 = 480 meters. Therefore, B loses by 500 - 480 = 20 meters.

15. **Three unbiased coins are tossed. What is the probability of getting at most two heads?**
   - Total outcomes = 2^3 = 8.
   - Outcomes with at most two heads = 7 (HHH excluded).
   - Probability = 7/8.
   - **Answer: 7/8**

16. **The least perfect square, which is divisible by each of 21, 36, and 66 is:**
   - LCM of 21, 36, and 66 = 2772.
   - The smallest perfect square multiple of 2772 = 2772^2 = 213444.
   - **Answer: 213444**

17. **A farmer bought toffees at 6 for a rupee. How many for a rupee must he sell to gain 20%?**
   - Cost price of one toffee = 1/6 rupee.
   - Selling price to gain 20% = 1/6 * 1.20 = 1/5 rupee.
   - So, he must sell 5 for a rupee.
   - **Answer: 5**

18. **A train of length 110 meters is running at a speed of 60 kmph. In what time, it will pass a man who is running at 6 kmph in the direction opposite to that in which the train is going?**
   - Relative speed = 60 + 6 = 66 kmph = (66 * 1000) / 3600 = 18.33 m/s.
   - Time taken = 110 / 18.33 ≈ 6 seconds.
   - **Answer: 6**
