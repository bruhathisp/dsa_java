# Frequently Asked Aptitude Questions from Zoho Campus Placements

Here are some frequently asked aptitude questions from Zoho campus placements along with solutions to help you prepare:

## Frequently Asked Questions

1. **If the selling price is doubled, the profit triples. Find the profit percent.**
   - Let the cost price be \( C \) and the selling price be \( S \).
   - Given \( 2S - C = 3(S - C) \).
   - Solving, \( 2S - C = 3S - 3C \).
   - \( S = 2C \).
   - Profit percent \( = \frac{S - C}{C} \times 100 = \frac{2C - C}{C} \times 100 = 100\% \).
   - **Answer: 100**

2. **A certain amount earns a simple interest of Rs. 1750 after 7 years. Had the interest been 2% more, how much more interest would it have earned?**
   - Let the principal be \( P \) and the original rate be \( R \).
   - \( \frac{P \times R \times 7}{100} = 1750 \).
   - New rate \( = R + 2 \).
   - New interest \( = \frac{P \times (R+2) \times 7}{100} - 1750 \).
   - **Answer: Data inadequate**
   - **Explanation**: To determine the additional interest earned with a 2% higher rate, we need the principal amount, which is not provided. Hence, the data is inadequate.

3. **The calendar for the year 2007 will be the same as which year?**
   - A calendar repeats after a cycle of 400 years.
   - 2007 + 11 (as 2007 + 7 = 2014 is a leap year, so next similar year is 2018).
   - **Answer: 2018**

4. **A library has an average of 510 visitors on Sundays and 240 on other days. The average number of visitors per day in a month of 30 days beginning with a Sunday is:**
   - Number of Sundays = 5.
   - Total visitors = \( 5 \times 510 + 25 \times 240 = 2550 + 6000 = 8550 \).
   - Average per day = \( \frac{8550}{30} = 285 \).
   - **Answer: 285**

5. **What will be the least number that when doubled will be exactly divisible by 12, 18, 21, and 30?**
   - LCM of 12, 18, 21, 30 = 1260.
   - Least number = 1260 / 2 = 630.
   - **Answer: 1260**

6. **A motorboat, whose speed is 15 km/hr in still water goes 30 km downstream and comes back in a total of 4 hours 30 minutes. The speed of the stream (in km/hr) is:**
   - Let the speed of the stream be \( x \).
   - Downstream speed = 15 + x.
   - Upstream speed = 15 - x.
   - Total time = 4.5 hours.
   - \( \frac{30}{15+x} + \frac{30}{15-x} = 4.5 \).
   - Solving gives \( x = 5 \).
   - **Answer: 5**

7. **Odd one out – 6, 9, 15, 21, 24, 28, 30:**
   - 28 is not divisible by 3.
   - **Answer: 28**

8. **A man completes a journey in 10 hours. He travels the first half of the journey at the rate of 21 km/hr and the second half at the rate of 24 km/hr. Find the total journey in km.**
   - Let the total distance be \( 2x \).
   - \( \frac{x}{21} + \frac{x}{24} = 10 \).
   - Solving gives \( x = 105 \).
   - Total distance = \( 2x = 210 \).
   - **Answer: 224**

9. **A, B, and C subscribe to Rs. 50,000 for a business. A subscribes Rs. 4000 more than B and B Rs. 5000 more than C. Out of a total profit of Rs. 35,000, A receives:**
   - Let C = \( x \), B = \( x + 5000 \), A = \( x + 9000 \).
   - \( x + (x + 5000) + (x + 9000) = 50000 \).
   - Solving gives \( x = 12000 \).
   - Total capital = \( 12000 + 17000 + 21000 = 50000 \).
   - A's share = \( \frac{21000}{50000} \times 35000 = 14700 \).
   - **Answer: 14700**

10. **The sum of the present ages of a father and his son is 60 years. Six years ago, father’s age was five times the age of the son. After 6 years, the son’s age will be:**
    - Let the present age of the son be \( x \) and the father be \( 60-x \).
    - \( 60 - x - 6 = 5(x-6) \).
    - Solving gives \( x = 14 \).
    - Son's age after 6 years = 20.
    - **Answer: 20**

11. **How many times are the hands of a clock at a right angle in a day?**
    - In 12 hours, hands are at right angles 22 times.
    - In 24 hours, hands are at right angles 44 times.
    - **Answer: 44**

12. **In how many different ways can the letters of the word ‘LEADING’ be arranged in such a way that the vowels always come together?**
    - Vowels: EAI.
    - Consonants: LNDG.
    - Treat vowels as a single entity.
    - Total arrangements = \( 5! \times 3! = 120 \times 6 = 720 \).
    - **Answer: 720**

13. **The sum of the squares of three numbers is 138, while the sum of their products taken two at a time is 131. Their sum is:**
   - Let the numbers be \( a, b, c \).
   - Given, \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 138 \) and \( ab + bc + ca = 131 \).
   - Using the identity \( (a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) \), we get \( (a + b + c)^2 = 138 + 2 \times 131 = 400 \).
   - Therefore, \( a + b + c = \sqrt{400} = 20 \).
   - **Answer: 20**

14. **In a 500 m race, the ratio of the speeds of two contestants A and B is 3:4. A has a start of 140 m. Then, A wins by:**
   - Speed ratio \( = 3:4 \).
   - Distance covered by A when B covers 500 m: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 500 = 375 \) m.
   - Total distance covered by A \( = 375 + 140 = 515 \).
   - A wins by \( 515 - 500 = 15 \) m.
   - **Answer: 20m**
   - **Explanation**: Speed ratio \(= 3:4\). When A covers 360 meters, B covers \( \frac{4}{3} \times 360 = 480 \) meters. Therefore, B loses by \( 500 - 480 = 20 \) meters.

15. **Three unbiased coins are tossed. What is the probability of getting at most two heads?**
   - Total outcomes = \( 2^3 = 8 \).
   - Outcomes with at most two heads = 7 (HHH excluded).
   - Probability = \( \frac{7}{8} \).
   - **Answer: 7/8**

16. **The least perfect square, which is divisible by each of 21, 36, and 66 is:**
   - LCM of 21, 36, and 66 = 2772.
   - The smallest perfect square multiple of 2772 = \( 2772^2 = 213444 \).
   - **Answer: 213444**

17. **A farmer bought toffees at 6 for a rupee. How many for a rupee must he sell to gain 20%?**
   - Cost price of one toffee = \( \frac{1}{6} \) rupee.
   - Selling price to gain 20% = \( \frac{1}{6} \times 1.20 = \frac{1.20}{6} = \frac{1}{5} \) rupee.
   - So, he must sell
