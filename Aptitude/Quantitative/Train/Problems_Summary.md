# Problems on Train

The given formula can be simplified as follows:

1. **Time taken by a train of length _l_ meters to pass a pole or standing man or a signal post**:
   - Time = _l_ / (speed of the train)

2. **Time taken by a train of length _l_ meters to pass a stationary object of length _b_ meters**:
   - Time = (_l_ + _b_) / (relative speed)

3. **Relative speed**:
   - When moving in the same direction: _u_ - _v_ m/s
   - When moving in opposite directions: _u_ + _v_ m/s

4. **If two trains of length _a_ meters and _b_ meters are moving in opposite directions at speeds _u_ m/s and _v_ m/s**:
   - Time taken by the trains to cross each other = (_a_ + _b_) / (_u_ + _v_) sec

5. **If two trains of length _a_ meters and _b_ meters are moving in the same direction at speeds _u_ m/s and _v_ m/s**:
   - Time taken by the faster train to cross the slower train = (_a_ + _b_) / (_u_ - _v_) sec

6. **If two trains (or bodies) start at the same time from points A and B towards each other and after crossing they take _a_ and _b_ sec in reaching B and A respectively**:
   - (A's speed) : (B's speed) = _b_ : _a_



The conversion formulas between kilometers per hour (km/hr) and meters per second (m/s):

To convert from kilometers per hour (km/hr) to meters per second (m/s):
Speed in m/s = (Speed in km/hr * 5) / 18

To convert from meters per second (m/s) to kilometers per hour (km/hr):
Speed in km/hr = (Speed in m/s * 18) / 5
