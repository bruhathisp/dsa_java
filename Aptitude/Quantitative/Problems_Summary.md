# Problems on Train



1. **Time taken by a train of length \( l \) meters to pass a pole or standing man or a signal post**:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{l}{\text{speed of the train}} \]

2. **Time taken by a train of length \( l \) meters to pass a stationary object of length \( b \) meters**:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{l + b}{\text{relative speed}} \]

3. **Relative speed**:
   - When moving in the same direction: \( u - v \) m/s
   - When moving in opposite directions: \( u + v \) m/s

4. **If two trains of length \( a \) meters and \( b \) meters are moving in opposite directions at speeds \( u \) m/s and \( v \) m/s**:
\[ \text{Time taken by the trains to cross each other} = \frac{a + b}{u + v} \text{ sec} \]

5. **If two trains of length \( a \) meters and \( b \) meters are moving in the same direction at speeds \( u \) m/s and \( v \) m/s**:
\[ \text{Time taken by the faster train to cross the slower train} = \frac{a + b}{u - v} \text{ sec} \]

6. **If two trains (or bodies) start at the same time from points A and B towards each other and after crossing they take \( a \) and \( b \) sec in reaching B and A respectively**:
\[ \text{(A's speed)} : \text{(B's speed)} = \frac{b}{a} \]

The conversion formulas between kilometers per hour (km/hr) and meters per second (m/s):

1. To convert from km/hr to m/s:
\[ \text{Speed in m/s} = \frac{\text{Speed in km/hr} \times 5}{18} \]

2. To convert from m/s to km/hr:
\[ \text{Speed in km/hr} = \frac{\text{Speed in m/s} \times 18}{5} \]
