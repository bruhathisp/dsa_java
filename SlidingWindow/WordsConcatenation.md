[Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/concatenated-words/)



Let's break down this specific line of code within the `canForm` method:

```java
if (dp[j] && wordSet.contains(word.substring(j, i)) && !word.substring(j, i).equals(word)) {
```

This line checks three conditions. Let's go through each condition in detail:

### 1. `dp[j]`
This condition checks if the substring `word[0:j]` can be formed by concatenating words from the `wordSet`.

- `dp[j]` is a boolean value.
- `dp[j] == true` means that the substring `word[0:j]` (from the start of the word to the `j`-th position) can be formed by concatenating words that are in the `wordSet`.

### 2. `wordSet.contains(word.substring(j, i))`
This condition checks if the substring `word[j:i]` exists in the `wordSet`.

- `word.substring(j, i)` creates a substring from the `j`-th position to the `i`-th position.
- `wordSet.contains(...)` checks if this substring is a valid word in the set.

### 3. `!word.substring(j, i).equals(word)`
This condition ensures that the entire word itself is not considered as a concatenated word.

- `word.substring(j, i).equals(word)` would be `true` if the substring `word[j:i]` is equal to the entire `word`.
- The `!` operator negates this condition, so the check ensures that the substring `word[j:i]` is not the entire word itself.

### Combined Condition
Now, let's see what happens when these conditions are combined:

```java
if (dp[j] && wordSet.contains(word.substring(j, i)) && !word.substring(j, i).equals(word)) {
    dp[i] = true;
    break;
}
```

- **First Condition (`dp[j]`)**: Checks if the substring `word[0:j]` can be formed using the words in `wordSet`.
- **Second Condition (`wordSet.contains(word.substring(j, i))`)**: Checks if the substring `word[j:i]` is a valid word in `wordSet`.
- **Third Condition (`!word.substring(j, i).equals(word)`)**: Ensures that the substring `word[j:i]` is not the same as the entire word, enforcing that at least two smaller words are used.

If all three conditions are `true`, it means that the substring `word[0:i]` can be formed by concatenating words in `wordSet`:

- `dp[j]` being `true` means that `word[0:j]` can be formed by concatenating words in the set.
- `wordSet.contains(word.substring(j, i))` being `true` means that `word[j:i]` is a word in the set.
- The substring `word[j:i]` is not the entire word itself, ensuring we are forming `word[0:i]` using at least two words.

### What Happens Next
If all conditions are met:

1. **Update `dp[i]`**:
   ```java
   dp[i] = true;
   ```
   - This marks that the substring `word[0:i]` can be formed by concatenating words from `wordSet`.

2. **Break the Inner Loop**:
   ```java
   break;
   ```
   - Since we've found a valid way to form `word[0:i]`, we can stop further checks for this position `i` and move to the next position.

### Example Walkthrough
Consider the word "catsdogcats":

- For `i = 11` (checking "catsdogcats"):
  - `j = 7`:
    - `dp[7]` is `true` (meaning "catsdog" can be formed by "cats" + "dog").
    - `word.substring(7, 11)` is "cats", which is in `wordSet`.
    - "cats" is not equal to "catsdogcats" (the entire word).

Since all conditions are met, `dp[11]` is set to `true`, indicating that "catsdogcats" can be formed by concatenating other words from the set.

### Summary
The line:
```java
if (dp[j] && wordSet.contains(word.substring(j, i)) && !word.substring(j, i).equals(word)) {
```
ensures that the substring `word[0:i]` can be formed by:
1. Confirming `word[0:j]` can be formed by words in the set.
2. Verifying `word[j:i]` is a valid word in the set.
3. Ensuring `word[j:i]` is not the whole word, thus enforcing at least two words in the concatenation.

This ensures that only valid concatenated words are recognized and marked accordingly in the `dp` array.

Sure! Let's explain the line `return dp[n];` in the context of the `canForm` method:

### Context
The `canForm` method is designed to determine if a given word can be formed by concatenating at least two other words from the provided set of words (`wordSet`). It uses dynamic programming to achieve this.

### Dynamic Programming Array (`dp`)
- The `dp` array is a boolean array of size `n + 1`, where `n` is the length of the word.
- `dp[i]` indicates whether the substring `word[0:i]` (i.e., from the start of the word to the `i`-th character) can be formed by concatenating words from the set.

### Final Return Statement
```java
return dp[n];
```

### Explanation
1. **`n`**:
   - `n` is the length of the word.
   - `dp[n]` refers to the value at the `n`-th index of the `dp` array.

2. **`dp[n]`**:
   - This value indicates whether the entire word (i.e., the substring from the start to the end of the word) can be formed by concatenating words from the set.

### Purpose of `return dp[n];`
- The method returns `dp[n]` to indicate if the entire word can be formed by concatenation.
- If `dp[n]` is `true`, it means the word can be formed by concatenating at least two other words from the set.
- If `dp[n]` is `false`, it means the word cannot be formed by concatenating other words from the set.

### Example Walkthrough
Consider the word "catsdogcats" with `n = 11`:

- Suppose `dp` array after processing is:
  ```java
  [true, false, false, true, true, false, false, true, false, false, true, true]
  ```
  - `dp[0]` is `true`: An empty string can be formed trivially.
  - `dp[3]` is `true`: "cat" can be formed by "cat".
  - `dp[7]` is `true`: "catsdog" can be formed by "cats" + "dog".
  - `dp[11]` is `true`: "catsdogcats" can be formed by "catsdog" + "cats".

- The method will return `dp[11]`, which is `true`, indicating that "catsdogcats" can indeed be formed by concatenating words from the set.

### Summary
The line `return dp[n];` serves as the final check and output of the `canForm` method. It effectively determines whether the entire word can be constructed by concatenating other words from the set by referring to the value in the dynamic programming array that corresponds to the full length of the word.

    public List<String> findAllConcatenatedWordsInADict(String[] words) {

        for (String word : words) {
            wordSet.add(word);
        }

        for (String word : words) {
            if (canForm(word, wordSet)) {
                result.add(word);
            }
        }

        return result;
    }

    private boolean canForm(String word, Set<String> wordSet) {
        if (word.isEmpty()) return false;
        
        int n = word.length();
        boolean[] dp = new boolean[n + 1];
        dp[0] = true;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (dp[j] && wordSet.contains(word.substring(j, i)) && !word.substring(j, i).equals(word)) {
                    dp[i] = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[n];
    }
}

```
