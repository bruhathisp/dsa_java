To determine if one string is a permutation of another within a substring, you can use the sliding window technique combined with character counting. The approach is to use two frequency arrays (or hashmaps) to keep track of character counts in `s1` and the current window in `s2`. 

### Approach

1. **Character Count Arrays:**
   - Create a count array for `s1` which records the frequency of each character in `s1`.
   - Create a count array for the current window in `s2`.

2. **Sliding Window:**
   - Use a sliding window of the same length as `s1` to traverse `s2`.
   - Update the window count as the window slides over `s2`.

3. **Check Permutation:**
   - Compare the window count array with the `s1` count array at each step.
   - If they match, it means the current window is a permutation of `s1`.

### Implementation

Here's the implementation in Java:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean checkInclusion(String s1, String s2) {
        if (s1.length() > s2.length()) return false;
        
        int[] s1Count = new int[26];
        int[] s2Count = new int[26];
        
        // Populate the s1Count with the frequency of each character in s1
        for (int i = 0; i < s1.length(); i++) {
            s1Count[s1.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
        }
        
        // Initialize the window in s2
        for (int i = 0; i < s1.length(); i++) {
            s2Count[s2.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
        }
        
        // Compare the initial window with s1Count
        if (matches(s1Count, s2Count)) return true;
        
        // Slide the window across s2
        for (int i = s1.length(); i < s2.length(); i++) {
            // Add the new character to the window
            s2Count[s2.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
            // Remove the old character from the window
            s2Count[s2.charAt(i - s1.length()) - 'a']--;
            
            // Compare the current window with s1Count
            if (matches(s1Count, s2Count)) return true;
        }
        
        return false;
    }
    
    // Helper function to compare two frequency arrays
    private boolean matches(int[] s1Count, int[] s2Count) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (s1Count[i] != s2Count[i]) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialize Character Count Arrays:**
   - `s1Count` and `s2Count` arrays of size 26 are used to store the frequency of characters 'a' to 'z'.

2. **Populate s1Count:**
   - Count the frequency of each character in `s1`.

3. **Initialize the Sliding Window:**
   - Populate `s2Count` for the first `s1.length()` characters in `s2`.

4. **Check Initial Window:**
   - Compare the frequency arrays of the initial window in `s2` with `s1Count`.

5. **Slide the Window:**
   - Slide the window one character at a time through `s2`.
   - Update the `s2Count` array by adding the new character and removing the old character that goes out of the window.
   - Compare the updated `s2Count` array with `s1Count`.

6. **Helper Function:**
   - `matches(int[] s1Count, int[] s2Count)`: Checks if two frequency arrays are identical.

### Examples:

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** `s1 = "ab"`, `s2 = "eidbaooo"`
- **Output:** `true`
- **Explanation:** The substring "ba" is a permutation of `s1`.

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** `s1 = "ab"`, `s2 = "eidboaoo"`
- **Output:** `false`
- **Explanation:** No permutation of `s1` is a substring of `s2`.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of `s2`. Each character is processed a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since the size of the count arrays is fixed (26).

This solution efficiently checks if `s2` contains a permutation of `s1` using a sliding window and character counting, ensuring optimal performance.
