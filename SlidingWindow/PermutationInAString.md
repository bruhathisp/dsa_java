To determine if one string is a permutation of another within a substring, you can use the sliding window technique combined with character counting. The approach is to use two frequency arrays (or hashmaps) to keep track of character counts in `s1` and the current window in `s2`. 

**Note: ensure that we check for equality every time we update the s2count array.  so the Array.equals(s1count,s2count) must be inside the initialisation loop too**

### Approach

1. **Character Count Arrays:**
   - Create a count array for `s1` which records the frequency of each character in `s1`.
   - Create a count array for the current window in `s2`.

2. **Sliding Window:**
   - Use a sliding window of the same length as `s1` to traverse `s2`.
   - Update the window count as the window slides over `s2`.

3. **Check Permutation:**
   - Compare the window count array with the `s1` count array at each step.
   - If they match, it means the current window is a permutation of `s1`.

### Implementation

Here's the implementation in Java:

```java

  
class Solution {
    public boolean checkInclusion(String s1, String s2) {

        if(s1.length()>s2.length()){
            return false;
        }

        int[] s1count= new int[26];
        int[] s2count= new int[26];

        for(int i=0; i<s1.length(); i++){

            s1count[s1.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
            s2count[s2.charAt(i) - 'a']++;

        }

        if (Arrays.equals(s1count,s2count)){
            return true;
        }

        for (int j=s1.length(); j< s2.length();j++){
            s2count[s2.charAt(j) - 'a']++;
            // s2.charAt(i) - 'a'
            s2count[s2.charAt(j-s1.length()) - 'a']--;

            if (Arrays.equals(s1count,s2count)){
            return true;
        }

        }

        

        return false;
        
    }
}

```

### Explanation

1. **Initialize Character Count Arrays:**
   - `s1Count` and `s2Count` arrays of size 26 are used to store the frequency of characters 'a' to 'z'.

2. **Populate s1Count:**
   - Count the frequency of each character in `s1`.

3. **Initialize the Sliding Window:**
   - Populate `s2Count` for the first `s1.length()` characters in `s2`.

4. **Check Initial Window:**
   - Compare the frequency arrays of the initial window in `s2` with `s1Count`.

5. **Slide the Window:**
   - Slide the window one character at a time through `s2`.
   - Update the `s2Count` array by adding the new character and removing the old character that goes out of the window.
   - Compare the updated `s2Count` array with `s1Count`.

6. **Arrays.equals() function:**
   - Checks if two frequency arrays are identical.

### Examples:

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** `s1 = "ab"`, `s2 = "eidbaooo"`
- **Output:** `true`
- **Explanation:** The substring "ba" is a permutation of `s1`.

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** `s1 = "ab"`, `s2 = "eidboaoo"`
- **Output:** `false`
- **Explanation:** No permutation of `s1` is a substring of `s2`.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of `s2`. Each character is processed a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since the size of the count arrays is fixed (26).

This solution efficiently checks if `s2` contains a permutation of `s1` using a sliding window and character counting, ensuring optimal performance.
