# Approach 1 O(n)- sliding window
### Java Implementation and Explanation

To solve the problem of finding the minimal length of a subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to the given target, we can use the sliding window approach. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialization**: Start with two pointers, `start` and `end`, both set at the beginning of the array. Use a variable `sum` to keep track of the current window sum, and `minLength` to keep track of the minimal length of a valid subarray.

2. **Expand the Window**: Move the `end` pointer to the right, adding the current element to the `sum`.

3. **Shrink the Window**: If the `sum` is greater than or equal to the `target`, update the `minLength` and then move the `start` pointer to the right to see if we can find a smaller subarray that still meets the condition.

4. **Return the Result**: After iterating through the array, if `minLength` was updated from its initial value, return it. Otherwise, return 0, indicating no valid subarray was found.  ` return minLength == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? 0 : minLength`

### Java Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int minSubArrayLen(int target, int[] nums) {
        int start = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        int minLength = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        for (int end = 0; end < nums.length; end++) {
            sum += nums[end];

            while (sum >= target) {
                minLength = Math.min(minLength, end - start + 1);
                sum -= nums[start];
                start++;
            }
        }

        return minLength == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? 0 : minLength;
    }
}
```

### Cornell Notes

**Title:** Minimal Length Subarray Sum

**Concept:**
- Given an array of positive integers and a target, find the minimal length of a subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to the target.
- If no such subarray exists, return 0.

**Steps:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - `start` pointer at the beginning of the array.
   - `sum` to keep track of the current window sum.
   - `minLength` to track the minimal length of a valid subarray.

2. **Expand the Window:**
   - Iterate through the array using the `end` pointer.
   - Add the current element to `sum`.

3. **Shrink the Window:**
   - When `sum` is greater than or equal to `target`, update `minLength`.
   - Move the `start` pointer to the right to find smaller valid subarrays.
   - Continue until `sum` is less than `target`.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - If `minLength` was updated, return it.
   - Otherwise, return 0.

**Example:**

- **Input:** `target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]`
  - **Output:** `2`
  - **Explanation:** The subarray `[4,3]` has the minimal length (2).

- **Input:** `target = 4, nums = [1,4,4]`
  - **Output:** `1`
  - **Explanation:** The subarray `[4]` has the minimal length (1).

- **Input:** `target = 11, nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]`
  - **Output:** `0`
  - **Explanation:** No subarray has a sum greater than or equal to 11.

**Key Points:**

- Use the sliding window technique to efficiently find the minimal length subarray.
- Adjust the window size dynamically by moving the `start` and `end` pointers.
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array.
- Space complexity: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

**Conclusion:**

This approach ensures that we find the minimal length subarray with a sum greater than or equal to the target in linear time, making it efficient for large input sizes.



# Another approach with O(nlogn)

Sure, let's simplify the provided solution while maintaining the functionality. Here's a cleaner version of the code:

### Simplified Java Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int minSubArrayLen(int target, int[] nums) {
        int low = 1, high = nums.length + 1;
        boolean found = false;
        
        while (low < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (isValidSubarray(mid, nums, target)) {
                found = true;
                high = mid;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return found ? low : 0;
    }

    private boolean isValidSubarray(int size, int[] nums, int target) {
        int sum = 0, maxSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            sum += nums[i];
        }
        
        maxSum = sum;
        
        for (int i = size; i < nums.length; i++) {
            sum += nums[i] - nums[i - size];
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, sum);
        }
        
        return maxSum >= target;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

**Overall Approach:**
- Use binary search on the size of the subarray to find the minimal length of the subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to the target.
- For each candidate subarray size, use a sliding window approach to check if there exists a subarray of that size with a sum greater than or equal to the target.

**Detailed Steps:**

1. **Binary Search on Subarray Size:**
   - Initialize `low` to 1 and `high` to `nums.length + 1`.
   - Use binary search to find the smallest subarray size that meets the condition.

2. **Check Validity of Subarray Size:**
   - Use a helper function `isValidSubarray` to check if there is a subarray of the given size with a sum greater than or equal to the target.
   - Implement a sliding window within `isValidSubarray` to efficiently calculate subarray sums.

**Simplification Details:**

1. **Binary Search Loop:**
   - Adjusted the loop and conditionals for clarity.
   - Use `found` flag to determine if any valid subarray was found.

2. **Sliding Window for Sum Calculation:**
   - Initially sum the first `size` elements.
   - Slide the window across the array, updating the sum and max sum accordingly.

### Key Points:

- The binary search ensures we efficiently narrow down the minimal length.
- The sliding window technique ensures we efficiently compute subarray sums within each candidate size.

This solution maintains an O(n log n) time complexity due to the binary search combined with the sliding window approach.
