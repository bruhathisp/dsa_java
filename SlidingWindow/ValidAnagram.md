## Explanation


1. **Problem Understanding**: We're given two strings `s` and `t` and we need to determine if `t` is an anagram of `s`.

2. **Initial Checks**: An obvious first check is to see if the lengths of both strings are equal. If they're not, then `t` cannot be an anagram of `s`, so we return `false`.

3. **Approach Selection**: Given the problem statement, we need a method to compare the characters in both strings to determine if they form the same set of characters, irrespective of their order. We could use various approaches like sorting the strings and comparing them, or using a character frequency counter. We'll explore character frequency counter approach with **Sliding Window**

4. **Data Structure Selection**: For the sliding window approach, we need a way to keep track of character frequencies. We choose an integer array `charCount`, where `charCount[i]` represents the count of character `'a' + i` in the string.

The expression `charCount[c - 'a']++;` is incrementing the count of a character `c` in the `charCount` array. Let me break it down:

- `c` is a character from the string `s`. 
- `'a'` is subtracted from `c`, which gives us an integer value representing the relative position of `c` in the lowercase English alphabet. For example, if `c` is `'c'`, then `c - 'a'` would be `2` because `'c' - 'a'` equals `2`.
- The result of `c - 'a'` is used as an index in the `charCount` array. Since `charCount` is an array representing character counts, we use this index to track the count of character `c`.
- Finally, `charCount[c - 'a']++;` increments the count of character `c` in the `charCount` array.


5. **Counting Characters**: We iterate through string `s` and increment the corresponding count in `charCount` for each character encountered.

6. **Sliding Window through `t`**: We iterate through string `t`. For each character encountered, we decrement its count in `charCount`. If the count becomes negative, it means `t` has more occurrences of that character than `s`, so we return `false`.

7. **Final Check**: After iterating through all characters in `t`, we ensure that all counts in `charCount` are zero. If they're not, it means `t` has missing or extra characters compared to `s`, so we return `false`.

8. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the strings `s` and `t`, as we only iterate through the strings once.
