**How to *internalize*** a DP problem like *Climbing Stairs*, and **how to recognize pattern**—without just memorizing it.

``` java
class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        int a = 1, b = 1; // n=0 and n=1 both have 1 way
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            int next = a + b;
            a = b;
            b = next;
        }
        return b;
    }
}
```

### 🌱 Step 1: **Forget the Code. Just Understand the Situation.**

> You’re climbing stairs. You can go up **1 step** or **2 steps** at a time. How many **different ways** are there to reach step `n`?

Start thinking *step by step*.

* If you're on **step 4**, how did you get there?

  * Maybe from step 3 (one step up) We can reach step three in 3 ways (111, 12, 21) 
  * Or from step 2 (two steps up) We can reach  step two in 2 ways (11, 2)

That leads to:

```text
ways(4) = ways(3) + ways(2)
```

And that's true for **any** step `i`:

```text
ways(i) = ways(i-1) + ways(i-2)
```

> That's **exactly** the Fibonacci definition.

### 🔍 Internalization Framework (Use for any DP)

**Ask these questions for every DP problem:**

1. **What are the "states"?**
   (Here: `ways(n)` = number of ways to reach step `n`)

2. **What are the "choices" at each state?**
   (Here: take 1 step or 2 steps)

3. **How can I reach a state from smaller states?**
   (If I'm on step `n`, I got here from either step `n-1` or `n-2`)

4. **Is there overlap in subproblems?**
   (Yes — computing `ways(4)` uses `ways(3)` and `ways(2)`, which get reused again and again)

→ That's dynamic programming.

### 🧠 How to Internalize DP
Instead of memorizing patterns like "this is Fibonacci", train your brain to:

1. Simulate small inputs by hand (n = 1, 2, 3, 4)
2. Ask how each state is built from previous ones
3. Write the **recurrence relation**
4. Then, and **only then**, think: "Hey, this looks like Fibonacci!"

### Simple Guide for a Noob to Nail Any DP Problem:

Find subproblem – what’s your DP state? Usually an index or remaining budget.

Find recurrence – express current state in terms of smaller states.

Set base case – simplest building block (e.g., dp[0]).

Choose iteration order – ensure all dependencies are computed (like prefix or suffix).

Optimize space if only recent states matter (e.g., Climbing Stairs).

### 🧠 If you get lost, ask:

What does dp[i] really mean?

What smaller states do I depend on?

Are those states already computed?
